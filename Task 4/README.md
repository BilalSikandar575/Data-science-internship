🎬 Exploratory Data Analysis on TMDB Movie Dataset
This project is part of the Data Science Internship – Task 4, where I performed a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world movie dataset from Kaggle.

📁 Dataset Used
Name: TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset
Source: Kaggle - TMDB 5000 Movie Metadata
Files: tmdb_5000_movies.csv
🧠 Objective
The main goal of this project is to:

Clean and preprocess the movie data
Visualize trends and patterns
Extract valuable insights from genres, ratings, companies, and other features
🔍 Tasks Performed
✅ Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Dropped irrelevant columns
Converted release dates to datetime
Extracted release year
✅ Descriptive Analysis
Total number of movies
Most common genres
Top 10 highest-rated movies
Average budget and revenue (excluding zero values)
✅ Visualizations
Bar chart of most common genres
Pie chart of rating categories (Low, Average, High)
Line chart of number of movies released per year
Heatmap of correlations (budget, revenue, rating, popularity)
